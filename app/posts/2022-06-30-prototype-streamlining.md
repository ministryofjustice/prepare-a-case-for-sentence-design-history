title: Streamlining the manage a workforce prototype
description: Why we decided to streamline our prototype into a single version of truth.

The previous version of the manage a workforce prototype had 13 different iterations, acting as a history of change throughout the time of designing the Allocations product.

As we have recently created this design history to document changes and decisions regarding the prototype, it felt like a good opportunity to create a single version of the truth, that is always up to date with the latest designs to test and build. This will mean that it is easier to test with users, as the full allocations user journey is contained within one version, rather than having to swap between versions to test various elements of the designs. It will also make creating tickets for development into the production product more simple.

The home page of the design history has been updated with the new link and password to the prototype.

The previous version of the prototype will still be hosted, but not maintained. If you would like to view the previous version, you can do so [by clicking here](https://workforce-management.apps.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/). The username and password are below.
